Wordpic: Draw pictures by describing them
==========================================
Wordpic allows you to draw pictures using words. It is heavily influenced by graphviz in its syntax, so if you're used to Graphviz to draw diagrams, this will seem natural to you. Hopefully, it will seem natural enough even if you dont use Graphviz.

Some examples
=============
See docs/idea.md for samples and more.

Status
======

- Learn to use Ometa/JS: IN PROGRESS. See docs/hard-earned-gyaan.txt for details.
- Build parser: IN PROGRESS
- Build interpreter: TBD
  - decide on Canvas wrapper
  - Implement it
- Executable formats:
  - build command line version: TBD
  - Integrate with browser : TBD
  - Build node module: TBD

Why
===
The original idea came to me from two things I was trying to do:

- Draw some simple architecture diagrams
- Do UI mockups using Balsamiq/Visio style tools

As an avid Graphviz user, I thought: "Wouldnt it be nice if I could just describe the picture, and a tool would draw it for me?"

Wordpic is the result.
