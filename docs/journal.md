Sat Apr  6 05:20:58 2013: was trying to get back into wordpic's logic and started reorg-ing its arch file. move all unmanageable stuff to v2.0 and started making the doc reflect the code. moved a lot of low level stuff down to move into appropriate child architecture node, but then got stalled by sid issue. so went and fixed that. now too sleepy to actuallly write something about wordpic arch.
