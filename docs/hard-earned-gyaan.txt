ometa wp {
   picture = "picture",
   name = string:n -> (alert("name:"+n)),
   stmts = string
}

// this works because its matching a stringorArrayLikeObject ie a string of letters with a rule
wp.matchAll('picture','picture')
// this still works because its matching an object (String) with a rule, and the defn of picture still is ok
//wp.match('picture ','name');
// this returns only the first char as matched with name because matchAll works on an array of chars, and each char is still a valid string
//wp.matchAll('blah','name');
// this returns the whole string because match works on an object, ie the entire string of chars
wp.match('blah','name');

moral of the story: use matchAll to parse into tokens, then use match to parse the tokenized stream (or graph of objects)

tbd: determine which functions in parser.js works on string and which on objects.
